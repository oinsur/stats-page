## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project, I decided to start with a mobile-first approach. 
I learned how to work with breakpoints using min-width and also learned
about how to work more with flexbox. I learned how to use blend modes 
with background images to accomplish the duotone look of the image in the layout as well.


### Continued development

I still need to get a better understanding of how to work with a mobile-first approach. I found a greater
appreciation for working in a mobile-first approach. I may adopt it as my starting point for future projects.

### Useful resources
